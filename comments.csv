want-to-say-this;"So many fears in China around kids disappearing. 

I am white and had a mixed Chinese baby born in a Chinese hospital. My in-laws have money and we were super vigilant. My son had at least me in the room at all times after being born. There was someone from our group awake with eye contact on the child at all times. And he would have been super identifiable as the white child in the hospital of all Chinese people. 

My FIL took me aside at a wedding 💒 n China once to tell me that under no circumstance do I believe what anyone says regarding watching the kids. Super serious staring me in the eyes. He said me my wife or him and my MIL should be the only one to hold my son and if anyone asks to hold my son who was a baby to run away.  


A few hours later before dinner. The maid told me she was told by him to take my son before dinner. And I was to go talk to my FIL. I remembered what he said and was like I’ll bring my son for the pictures opportunity. She kept insisting it was ok and that he told her to do it. I walked away with my son in my arms, and asked my FIL if he said that and he said no. I couldn’t sleep that night I had her fired and we got a new maid. I still think about it all the time. Just the thought of him being somewhere like confused and wondering why I’m not there to help just makes my heart stop.

Random_name46;"I have dealt with kinda similar systems, I think. If they're anything alike then yeah the locks disable with the fire alarm. 

In my workplace we had policies and training that the lockdown areas were monitored by staff while locks were disabled. So there would be designated people at each exit stopping anyone who shouldn't leave and that's their entire job throughout the alarm. 

The fire systems also gave an accurate location and type of alarm, so pretty much everyone would converge on that specific area to assess and combat any issues. It would be difficult to slip out unnoticed. I suppose you could have a partner pull a station across the building but then you'd still run into the people watching the lockdown doors.

hotbox4u;"Spains Dictator Franco did that with the help of the catholic church.

It started out with the kidnapping of children of republican parents who were either in jail or dead/killed by Francos troops. Those children were then given to Franco loyalists and forced into converting to Catholicism. 

Then they targeted single pregnant teenaged girls and put them and their children into state custody until they were 25. Those women were send to the Peña Grande maternity prison. Sometimes they would line up pregnant women in a room and bring in men who then could choose which girl they want to merry (along with the baby). Sometimes the men would 'return' the woman because they weren't satisfied with them and pick another. Conditions in that prison were so bad that many women committed suicide. 

And finally they move on to hospitals. Catholic nuns and priests would offer free maternal services and hospital stays, especially targeting young and poor women/families. This overtime grew into an actual business. The purpose of these abductions changed from ideological reasons to targeting parents, who the network considered ""morally- or economically- deficient"" and in some cases, they charged money. Parents were mostly told that their children had died and since the hospitals took care of the burials, they never saw the bodies. In many cases, the records were missing, either accidentally or because they were destroyed. The money was split between the catholic church and Franco's regime. 

This 'business' ran into the mid 80s (Franco died in 1975) and while it's impossible to learn the true scope, the number of abducted children is estimated to be up to 300,000.";https://oauth.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/y2yfwj/til_in_1912_4_yrold_bobby_dunbar_disappeared_was.json;3

He was adopted by Kathleen Kinsmiller Fliehr (1918–2003) and Richard Reid Fliehr (1918–2000). The Fliehrs decided to adopt due to Kathleen being unable to become pregnant after giving birth to a daughter who died shortly after.

He has an attachment disorder and because of it has impersonated more than 400 people, including 3 missing children. Now, two of these cases were pretty cut and dry- he turned up after a long period, claimed to be missing child, was tentatively welcomed in, but found to be an imposter through DNA forensics. The third, however, was more unusual. Bourdin was 20, six years older than the 13-y/o Nicholas Barkley he pretended to be. He had a french accent, and his eyes were brown, not blue, which he blamed- a little ridiculously- on them being changed by the child sex trafficking ring that 'abducted' him. The family, however, ate it all up. Some were skeptical- but the mother especially didn't question it one bit. However, getting off the plane, unlike his other 'relatives' she hung back, and didn't rush to greet him.

Eventually, he was got- a PI worked out his identity from the press and had him brought to custody. Bourdin was... glad. He was scared for his safety. Because being in that house for so long, he came to the realisation- they, specifically the mother and brother, murdered the original Nicholas. Bourdin hadn't done quite a good enough disguise, and literally any stranger could recognise the disguise for what it was, never mind close family of the victim- but the Barkley matriarch didn't seem to care. She was happy to have Bourdin around, even though she obviously didn't really believe him- obviously because he vindicated her, at least Bourdin posited.

tipdrill541;"This is fucked up. The Dunbar family was camping and Bobby went missing at night. It was concluded he drowned in a near by lake but was later suspected to have been kidnapped when his hat was found some distance from the lake 

Authorities came across a travelling sales man named William Cantwell Walters. He was accompanied by a 4 year old boy. The same age and appearance of Bobby. Walters said the boy was Bruce Anderson, the illegitimate son of Julia Anderson, his parents care taker.

Walters said he had permission to take the boyand Julia said that was true, but only for 2 days. He had been with Walters for over a year. She never reported Walters to the police, despite the fact that her son was only meant to be away for 2 days

They had the Dunbar parents examine the boy and meet him, but when they met, what happened next is disputed. Leslie Dunbar identified him as hers through moles and scars but the public thought this was suspicious as he was only missing for 8 months so she should have been able to tell whether it was him hy his face

Julia Anderson was also brought in to identify her supposed son. 4 boys were brought in one ag a time including Bruce. She didn't recognise any of them and none of them recognised hers. She requested they eb brought in again and recognised Bruce as hers after she undressed him and checked his moles 

William Cantwell Walters was convicted of kidnapping in 1914 despite people in Mississippi swearing that he had been traveling with the boy long before Bobby Dunbar disappeared. Walters won a new trial on appeal but because of the expense involved, authorities declined to try him again. He was released from jail after serving two years.

Many years later, Margaret Dunbar Cutright and Linda Traver, the respective granddaughters of Bobby Dunbar and Julia Anderson, set out to solve the Bobby Dunbar mystery. After much investigation, Margaret finally convinced her father, Robert Dunbar Jr., to submit to a DNA test.

The result showed that he was not related to the Dunbars at all; Bobby Dunbar, was in fact, Julia Anderson’s son, Bruce. 
Cutright and other family members suspect that Walters was Bruce’s father or uncle and that he had taken the boy in because his mother could not care for him.

From this article it sounds like Julia was ashamed of the situation. Ashamed that she was away from her child for over a year so she lied and said Walters was only supposed to take him for two years.

The Dunbars were able to put out a $6000 dollar reward ($160 000 in today's money for information a about their sons kidnapping. So they were rich. They wanted a replacement child and the authorities were on their side, so they were able to take another person's child";https://oauth.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/y2yfwj/til_in_1912_4_yrold_bobby_dunbar_disappeared_was.json;0

The books showed her in college looking for her ""adoptive"" mother and dealing with the death of one of her four parents IIRC. It's so character-driven that it actually ages well too, unlikely a lot of pre-internet stories where modern technology effectively ruins the plot. In the original book, she finds herself on a milk cartoon, recognizes the dress and her face, digs for the dress in her parents' attic, does some research at the library on news articles with little info, semi-accidentally mails a letter to the family's home (which they've made public so she could find them again). A big plot point whether the biological parents should let her talk on the phone or visit with her parents/family/friends for unlimited amounts of time or limit it so she can better settle in. You just need to change research at the library for googling a few low-information articles and change landline phone conversations with being glued to her cell phone.

So, the methods of that meta-analysis(link to it here https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/391812 ) had were to look for studies which the placebo were foods sweetened with artificial sweeteners. The issue with that is I'm not so sure it is sugar itself that is the issue as much as it is a spike in blood glucose. Some artificial sweeteners still raise blood glucose, and one in particular, maltodextrin, raises it well beyond what straight-up glucose ingestion does. I think for this to properly be done, we need to observe what blood glucose spikes specifically do to children rather than sugar itself and definitely we should not be using artificial sweeteners as the control group, unless they are sweeteners to be proven to have a 0 or really low glycemic index, such as erythritol, or else a natural one that does like stevia extract.

bread-guardian;"&gt; Sugar was never really my fight, but I always thought it was a little silly that the sugar industry has all this power in Washington. But I liked to spend my time on issues I might actually be able to change, and I knew the chances of winning a fight with Big Sugar was basically zero.

&gt; At one point in the mid-1990s, I got fed up and decided to yank their chains anyway. I was on the Agricultural Committee and were getting ready to put together the 1996 farm bill. I walked into my office while this was going on and found a sugar lobbyist hanging around, trying to stay close to the action. I felt like being a smart-ass so I made some wisecrack about the sugar industry raping the taxpayers. Without another word, I walked into my private office and shut the door. I had no real plan to go after the sugar people. I was just screwing with the guy.

&gt; My phone did not stop ringing for the next five weeks.... I had no idea how many people in my district were connected to the sugar industry. People were calling all day, telling me they made pumps or plugs or boxes or some other such part used in sugar production and I was threatening their job. Mayors called to tell me about employers their towns depended on who would be hurt by a sugar downturn. It was the most organize effort I had ever seen.

NadirPointing;"So the thing I can't square is that clearly sugar has mood effects, more strictly in the blood-sugar levels are directly correlated with mood and behavior.

There is a well known sugar withdrawal effects of headaches and dizziness during extreme diet changes. Further there are  studies about sucrose ingestion subsequently having dramatic changes in mood and behavior. It makes me think this ""hyperactivity"" measure is the element that's not sensitive to sugar rather than that it doesn't cause effects.

Grizzleyt;"It's because they read the study as saying, ""that thing you saw definitely didn't happen,"" which isn't necessarily true. As others have pointed out, things like being given a special treat, being in exciting social contexts like birthday parties, and the simple matter of nourishment=energy (especially when hungry / low blood sugar) means that kids could definitely be more active after the consumption of sugar.

The claim being refuted is that ""sugar causes hyperactivity"" which is specific about the root cause, the hypothesized resultant behavior, and possibly the mechanism (consumption of sugar as opposed to, say, the mental pathway of knowing you're getting a sugary food and thus being excited). 

So both can be ""true"" — sugar doesn't cause hyperactivity, and sugary treats are often associated with excited, energetic children.

Every child in the experiment got the same no-sugar sweet tasting treat, but it was the parents who believed their children were getting sugar who rated their children as significantly more hyperactive.

He is being delivered from his imposed fate, if only for that day, by the selfless and courageous actions of the daughter. Yet, they both understand the emotional cost of his survival.

Obversa;"Children fed by the same wet nurse were also called ""milk siblings"".

The concept of ""milk kinship"" was as follows:

&gt;Milk kinship, formed during nursing by a non-biological mother, was a form of fostering allegiance with fellow community members. This particular form of kinship did not exclude particular groups, such that class and other hierarchal systems did not matter in terms of milk kinship participation.  
&gt;  
&gt;Traditionally speaking, this practice predates the early modern period, though it became a widely used mechanism for developing alliances in many hierarchical societies during that time. Milk kinship used the practice of breast feeding by a wet nurse to feed a child either from the same community, or a neighbouring one. This wet nurse played the strategic role in forging relations between her family and the family of the child she was nursing, as well as their community.";https://oauth.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/y382vf/til_that_pope_innocent_viii_was_breastfed_while.json;6

Liesmyteachertoldme;The fuck?;https://oauth.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/y35ori/til_the_first_confirmed_victim_of_takata_airbags.json;2
coelurosauravus;"Ok so this is a weird one.  Basically as someone else said in another thread, the company that made the airbag inflators made a lot of them for a lot of automakers for a long time.

Prior to other companies being able to produce the inflators for permanent replacement, you had a handful of options for your car until autoliv and other companies got the necessary inflators

-Dont drive the car, leaving it either at home or on a dealer's lot

-drive the car on your own at your own risk(you could still file a suit if injured, the waiver merely acknowledged the risks were explained to you)

-be put in a rental for an unknown period of time(Honda exhausted enterprise's rental inventory at one point)

-put a new version of the defective airbag to reset the failure timer(heat, time and humidity being the most responsible for airbag failure)

-some folks went as far to disconnect the inflator entirely

It resulted in weird situations where honda dealers had vehicle owners swear with sugar on top that if they drove a car because the other options were exhausted or they couldn't be without their car, and they had passengers, they'd endeavor to put the passenger in the back seat which very likely ensured maybe a little more protection

I worked in the field for Honda on this kind of stuff, it was a very interesting few years

ahm713;"&gt; It’s also humid down in Florida where, in September 2014, Hien Tran was driving home from her family’s nail salon in Orlando.  
&gt;  
&gt;Like Ms Parham, she had a relatively minor crash in a Honda Accord. But when paramedics arrived they couldn’t understand the scene   before them. She had suffered a slash through her jugular vein.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Deep cuts on the right side of her neck were not consistent with crash injuries,” a report from the paramedics stated.  
&gt;  
&gt;“There were no windows broken ... that would cause sharp glass to penetrate a human’s body. Therefore, the force of the crash was not significant enough to cause great bodily harm to any occupant in both vehicles.”  
&gt;
&gt;It looked like Ms Tran had been stabbed, reported the New York Times. Initially, police looked into why someone might murder the Vietnamese immigrant, who never regained consciousness and later died.  
&gt;
&gt;**It was only when, a week later, a letter from Honda came through the post asking Ms Tran to get her car’s airbags fixed that police realised that was the cause.**

thrownaway6990;"This may have been true in the 90s early 2000s, but the manufacturer I work for requires pictures and verification of number swaps. And if the tech claims he did a job that he didn't do and for whatever reason another tech has to go in behind the first guy and finds the recall wasn't completed as stated. The first tech can have his number suspended and he could lose his job as well as the dealership could lose franchising rights. I only know this because one of our techs had alot of work closed under his number that later came back as incomplete. So now he is on a year long probation and has to have all warranty work signed off on by the shop foreman and service manager.
I worked with a couple of old Honda techs who claim that when this recall was in its prime they were going to junk yards to replace any airbags in any totalled vehicles as well so there was no risk of problems later on.

Code_Operator;"Takata teamed up with Rocket Research Co to develop the inflators. It was called the TAB program internally. RRC developed a proprietary propellant for them. Takata ended up buying out RRC’s interest in the joint venture, except for the propellant and the filters. As I recall, RRC was boning them for the propellant, so Takata went shopping for something cheaper.

coelurosauravus;"Used to work the door to door component of Honda's recall outreach prior to the pandemic.

I get that given the number of airbag deaths is low compared to total number of affected components that it seems like the risks are low.  Don't care.

Get it done, call your Honda dealer, it's free and the repair once the car rolls into the shop is under 15 minutes for the steering wheel and a little bit longer for the passenger component.

It's like having a shotgun or claymore pointed at your face, and even mundane tiny bumps can trigger the airbag sensor the old your car gets.

One dealer I worked with said a girl literally got out of her car at the dealer(key in ignition, I believe still running) and slammed the door closed in prep to get something out of her back seat and the airbag deployed with shrapnel.  Luckily it was just a new seat for her car that was needed

coelurosauravus;"To answer your question, it is highly unlikely your car is affected by this specific recall.

  Most Honda models that were affected were between the years 2001-2016ish?  Maybe even into 2018.  It was also not uniform across models.  '01 accords had mostly the driver side affected but passenger side would be fine and the civics would usually have both affected.

Without looking at your car, my guess is your airbags probably failed to deploy from vehicle and component age.  Electrical components and sensors get funky over time.  For all I know your inflator in your car may be disconnected or you may not have an inflator at all.
